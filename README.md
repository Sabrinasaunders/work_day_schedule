## Installation
This project was provided with starter code by UC Berkeley Bootcamp. Additional time slots were added to the HTML code, proper linkage of JS & CSS. Added code to JS to be able to interact with the DOM. Added ability to loop through the time slots showing the past, present and future hour.

## Usage
This application displays the hours during a work day (8am-5pm). At the top of the page the current date and time will show. The time block changes color; grey shows past hours, red shows the current hour and green shows the future hours. The user can input their calender events in the desired hour and save the content using the save button to the right of the block. The events will save via the users local storage, thus will remain even if the page is refreshed.
